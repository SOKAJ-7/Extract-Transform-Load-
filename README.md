# Extract-Transform-Load
Using Python and SQL to transform movie datasets from various sources and combine them into an SQL database


## Summary 
In this project, we extracted data on movies from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and MovieLens and transformed the data to make it suitable to be presented in an SQL database. Using user-defined functions and list comprehensions, this data was able to be cleaned by removing redundant and/or mostly-null rows as well as filtering out rows of little interest to our analysis. The dataframes created by this process were then joined and once again cleaned and transported into an SQL database to have queries preformed on them.
